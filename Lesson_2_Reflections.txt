**Lesson 2 Reflections**

========================

_**What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?**_

Iâ€™m basically creating a new place for Git to store the data of the snapshots I will be saving.

_**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?**_

The staging area is a middle transition point in between the working directory and the repository. The value of a staging area is that I can add and commit only the parts of the working directory that I want to add to the repository.

_**How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?**_



_**What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?**_

_**How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?**_

_**What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?**_

_**What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?**_
